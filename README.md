ECE 110 Integrated Design Challenge

The presented problem is to determine the terrain that the Boe-Bot drives across and then deliver a number which represents
the strength of the given terrain. The terrain is rocky if ramps are on both sides of the path, hilly if the ramps are on 
only one side of the path, and flat if the path has no ramps on either side. A flat terrain will return 1, a rocky terrain 
will return 1 plus the number of single ramps, and a hilly terrain will return 2 plus the number of paired ramps encountered. 
This number will be in the range of 1-5 and will then be displayed in Arabic counting numerals.
